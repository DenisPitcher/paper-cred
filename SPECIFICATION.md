# PathCheck Vaccination Credential
## Printed Card Specification Version 1
### Status
This document is a DRAFT, written by Justin Dossey
<justin.dossey@newcontext.com>.

### Purpose
This document describes the data fields and format of the inputs to the
PathCheck Vaccination Credential pre-printed card.

### Terms and Definitions
For the purposes of brevity, this document refers to the following terms which
are defined as follows:
1. **COUPON**: The **COUPON** QR code is designated to communicate eligibility for vaccination.
1. **BADGE**: The **BADGE** QR code is designated to contain information about the vaccines received by the **HOLDER**.
1. **STATUS**: The **STATUS** QR code is designated to contain information about the vaccination status of the **HOLDER**.
1. **PASSKEY**: The **PASSKEY** QR code contains information that can be correlated with other identification carried by the HOLDER to authenticate them.
1. **HOLDER**: The **HOLDER** is the party who has been or will be vaccinated, and is holding a pre-printed vaccination credential card.
1. **ISSUER**: The **ISSUER** is the party who delivers the vaccine and credential to a **HOLDER**.

### Data Types
This document will use the following terms to define data types.

1. **NUMERIC**: The **NUMERIC** data type is a sequence of integers between 0 and 99999999, inclusive.
2. **STRING**: The **STRING** data type is a sequence of unicode characters encoded as UTF-8, up to 255 bytes when encoded. 
3. **HASH**: The **HASH** data type is a sequence of alphanumeric characters containing a hexadecimal cryptographic hash. It is 64 bytes long.
3. **SIGNATUREHEX**: The **SIGNATUREHEX** data type is a sequence of alphanumeric characters containing a hexadecimal cryptographic digest. It is up to 72 bytes long.
4. **BIRTHDATE**: a date of birth, in [ISO 8601 (YYYYMMDD) Basic Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). Example: `20200201` is 1 February, 2020.
5. **SHORTSTRING**: a sequence of US-ASCII characters which is limited to 8 bytes in length.
6. **SHORTNUMERIC**: a **NUMERIC** with a maximum value of 9.

## Data Formats
Data represented in QR codes can be encoded in the following formats:
1. [JSON](https://json.org) Format. When data length is not at issue, this format is simple to read and parse.
2. URI Format. When data length is a concern, this format may use fewer bytes than JSON. Values in the URI format are [Percent Encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding).

With URI format, data is organized according to the following URI schema:
```
cred:type:version:signatureHex@keyId?data
```

Example:
```
cred:coupon:1:3046022100f82e28019428220d47be9b7dc9a50b4f0e6f9a6c95852a9272827cdbd8cb38d2022100b5d8738178cc1a12b590b25933857d967eb10178c5bbe045d132ec2513ddfa94@1a9?number=37&total=5000&city=San%20Francisco&phase=1B&indicator=Teacher
```


## QR Code Specifications
All QR codes contain a data set and a cryptographic signature. The cryptographic signature is a SHA256 digest in hexadecimal form, calculated using the private ECDSA key of the **ISSUER**. The two blocks are designated the **DATA** block and the **SIGNATURE** block.

### Data Ordering
In the JSON format, blocks and key/value pairs may occur in any order. For example, a JSON document with the **DATA** block after the **SIGNATURE** block is equivalent to a document with the **SIGNATURE** block after the **DATA** block.  Similarly, the key/value pairs within a block may appear in any order.

### Case Sensitivity
All fields (keys as well as values) are case-insensitive in both JSON and URI format. For clarity and ease of reading, examples in this document are given in mixed case. When performing operations such as hash comparison, a case-insensitive comparison function MUST be used.

### Signature and Hash Verification
Due to the Alphanumeric QR code character set, cryptographic signatures and hashes MUST be calculated against uppercased versions of the underlying data. Data to be used for hashes is serialized in the specified order. Signatures should be calculated against the actual data and order encoded to QR to permit
signature verification. In some cases, Percent encoding is used to address QR
code character set limitations. This encoding should be reversed before signature or hash verification.

### Format of the **SIGNATURE** Block
The signature block contains the hexadecimal ECDSA signature digest of the prepared **DATA** block and a keyId referencing the database and public key used to verify the ECDSA signature. For signature verification, devices should maintain indexed local key-value stores of approved public keys in PEM format. In the example below, the public key used to verify the signature is “1a9” in the “cdc” (local key/value) store.

#### Signature Fields
1. *keyId*: **SHORTSTRING**. a string describing the database and index of the
   public key to be used when verifying the cryptographic signature of the
   **DATA** block.
2. *hex*: **SIGNATUREHEX**. The hexadecimal SHA256 digest ECDSA signature of the
   **DATA** block, calculated according to the rules above.

Example Signature Block (JSON fragment)
```json
"signature": {
    "keyId": "cdc:1a9",
   "hex": "3045022100f239e3cc363a0ef44a72c3458ea69620375b0875c541b3e1e4973c0d14bd4b4b02205aec76cb66eafbd0ec232c55cd95248cfa80e01dfd71ecbce7afc3196cdf178d"
}
```

### Coupon Specification
Fields:
1. *version*: **NUMERIC**. The version of the specification defining the data communicated in this QR code.
1. *number*: **NUMERIC**. The unique identifying number assigned to this coupon.
1. *total*: **NUMERIC**. The total number of coupons issued in the batch of coupons this one was issued from.
1. *city*: **STRING**. The name of the city, town, or other local area which designates vaccination eligibility and delivery schedule for the **HOLDER**.
    1. When the city name contains characters which cannot be encoded to QR, the city name may be Percent Encoded as part of QR Code generation. Readers
    must decode any substitutions prior to signature verification.
    1. In the event the city name exceeds 255 bytes when encoded to UTF-8, the city name should be truncated until its length does not exceed 255 bytes.
1. *phase*: **SHORTSTRING**. The vaccination phase assigned to the **HOLDER**.
1. *indicator*: **SHORTSTRING**. An indication of the priority assignment for **HOLDER**, or the literal string "none" if there is no priority assignment.

#### Hashing Rules:
When generating a passkey hash (for inclusion in the **BADGE** structure), the
following rules MUST be followed to generate consistent results:
1. The only elements to be serialized should be the ones in the **DATA** block.
1. The elements MUST be concatenated in the following order, with the ctrl-^ (character code 30, hex 1E, RS, or Record Separator) delimiter:
    1. Number
    1. Total
    1. City
    1. Phase
    1. Indicator
1. The concatenation should be a UTF-8 string.
1. The concatenation MUST be converted to uppercase prior to hashing.
1. The elements MUST NOT be URL Encoded prior to hashing.
1. The output MUST be in hexadecimal format.

Thus, the SHA256 hash of the data in the example below would be calculated as in the following pseudo-code:

```
hash(“${number}\x1E${total}\x1E${city}\x1E${phase}\x1E${indicator}”) 
== hash(“37\x1E5000\x1EBOSTON\x1E1B\x1ETEACHER”)
-> “5a688b8230705d88b9f3bef1f23e099f8ee140e04c05a8575531808810019487”
TODO: recalculate hash
```

```json
{
  "type": "coupon",
  "version": 1,
  "data": {
    "number": 37,
    "total": 5000,
    "city": "Boston",
    "phase": "1B",
    "indicator": "Teacher"
  },
  "signature": {
    "keyId": "cdc:1a9",
